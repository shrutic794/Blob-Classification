#  Blob Classification using Computer Vision

##  Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying **blobs** (binary large objects or connected pixel regions) in images using computer vision techniques. It is designed for applications such as waste sorting, biomedical imaging, and industrial inspection, where object shape, size, or color can be used for categorization.

##  Key Features
-  **Blob Detection**: Identifies and segments distinct connected components (blobs) in images.
-  **Feature Extraction**: Calculates blob properties like area, perimeter, aspect ratio, circularity, and color histograms.
-  **Classification**: Classifies blobs into predefined categories using machine learning models (e.g., SVM, k-NN).
-  **Visualization**: Overlays bounding boxes and labels on detected blobs for intuitive inspection.

- **OpenCV** – Image processing and contour detection
- **scikit-learn** – Classification models
- **NumPy, Matplotlib** – Numerical operations and visualizations
